# README 

This is a python bot that I created for myself to automate the parsing of links from an archive / HTML file of mulitple discord channels. These files contains the message history of multiple discord channels that contain a large amount of links, this bot searches for specific patterns or URLs and pastes them to a discord channel. 

## Usage / Commands

```!paste```: Pastes links


There are much more commands that the bot has, and can be found through the help command list when added to your server!

## Permissions

Recommended to give the bot administrator as I have not tested the bot using specific moderation permissions.
